Web Applets is a [Mozilla Builders](https://builders.mozilla.org/) project.

## What is it?

**Web Applets is an open specification for building software that both humans and AI can understand and use together.** Instead of forcing AI to operate traditional point-and-click apps built for humans, Web Applets creates a new kind of web software designed for human-AI collaboration. You can read more about it on our website.
